# Zenc

A relaxation web game created by Elijah Watson, Sam Fruechtemeyer, and Eric Bender

-----------------

## Development installation
##### For the devs only since it requires access to the Firebase project

Run  `npm run install-all`  to install all the required dependencies
Then run  `npm run start`  to start the local web server

The web server is hot reloadable so just change whatever file and save it. You should then see your changes in the browser.
